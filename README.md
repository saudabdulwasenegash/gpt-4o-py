## Introduction

In the age of AI, having an efficient way to interact with models like GPT-4 can transform how we approach tasks. **GPT-4O-Py** serves as a bridge, making it easier for developers and enthusiasts to utilize the capabilities of GPT-4 without getting lost in complexities.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use, so you can focus on your project.
- **Robust Functionality**: Access the full power of GPT-4 with simple commands.
- **Customization Options**: Tailor the model's behavior to fit your needs.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and examples to get you started quickly.

## Installation

To get started with **GPT-4O-Py**, you need to install it on your local machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saudabdulwasenegash/gpt-4o-py.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gpt-4o-py
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment for cleaner management:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

## Usage

Using **GPT-4O-Py** is straightforward. After installation, you can start making calls to the GPT-4 model.

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the library:

```python
from gpt4o import GPT4O

gpt = GPT4O(api_key='your_api_key_here')
response = gpt.query("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)
```

This simple code snippet initializes the GPT-4O class and sends a query to the model. The response will contain the answer you seek.

## Examples

### Basic Query

You can easily ask questions and get answers:

```python
response = gpt.query("Explain the theory of relativity.")
print(response)
```

### Customizing Responses

You can customize the tone and style of responses:

```python
response = gpt.query("Write a friendly introduction to Python.", tone='friendly')
print(response)
```

### Batch Processing

For efficiency, you can send multiple queries at once:

```python
queries = [
    "What is AI?",
    "How does machine learning work?",
    "What are neural networks?"
]

responses = gpt.batch_query(queries)
for res in responses:
    print(res)
```
